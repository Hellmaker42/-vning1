    <p id="fromwiki">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>The <strong>yellow-faced honeyeater</strong> (<em>Caligavis chrysops</em>) is a small to medium-sized bird in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeyeater">honeyeater</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)">family</a>, Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its 
        <br>loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montane_ecosystems#Subalpine_zone">subalpine areas</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland">woodlands</a> along 
        <br>creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksia"></i>Banksia</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grevillea"></i>Grevillea</em></a>, and soft 
        <br>fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning_(birds)">gleaning</a> them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.

        Some yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration">migrate</a> northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland">Queensland</a>, and return in July and August to breed in southern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales">New South 
        <br>Wales</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)">Victoria</a>. They form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy_in_animals">socially monogamous</a> pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_nest#Cup">cup-shaped nest</a>. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.

        Honeyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">International Union for Conservation of 
        <br>Nature</a> (IUCN) to be of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-concern_species">least concern</a> for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2> [<a href="">Edit</a>]
    <hr>
    <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater was first <a href="">described</a>, and placed in the genus <a href="">Sylvia</a>, by ornithologist <a href="">John Latham</a> 
    in his 1801 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici,
     sive Systematis Ornithologiae.[2][3] French ornithologist <a href="">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> described it as Melithreptus gilvicapillus in 1817, and English 
     zoologist 
     <a href="">George Robert Gray</a> as Ptilotis trivirgata in 1869.[4] The specific name chrysops is derived from the <a href="">Ancient Greek</a> words chrysos meaning 
     'gold' and prosopo 
     meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.[5]</p>

    <p>The yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera <a href=""></i>Meliphaga</em></a> and then <a href=""></i>Lichenostomus</em></a> until 2011.[4] Delineating 
    the latter genus had been systematically 
    contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense <a href="">taxon</a> and <a href="">nucleotide</a> sampling, confirmed 
    previous findings that 
    Lichenostomus is not <a href="">monophyletic.</a>[6] Five species have previously been described as comprising the Caligavis subgroup, but studies, using the 
    <a href="">mitochondrial</a> 
    DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the <a href="">black-throated honeyeater</a> 
    (C. subfrenatus) and the <a href="">obscure honeyeater</a> (C. obscurus) of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus <a href=""></i>Caligavis. </em></a>
    The generic name derives from the Latin caligo 'mist, obscurity' and avis 'bird'.[7] <a href="">The bridled honeyeater</a> (B. frenatus) and the 
    <a href="">Eungella honeyeater </a>
    (B. hindwoodi) were sufficiently different to be placed in a separate genus as <a href=""></i>Bolemoreus.</em></a>[8] A 2017 genetic study, using both mitochondrial and
     nuclear DNA, 
    found the ancestor of the yellow-faced honeyeater diverged from the common ancestor of the other two Caligavis species around seven million years ago.

    [9] There are three <a href="">subspecies</a> of the yellow-faced honeyeater, two of which were described by <a href="">Gregory Mathews</a> in 1912.[10][11] 
    There are only very slight differences 
    between the nominate race and C. c. samueli found in the <a href="">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> in <a href="">South Australia</a>, and C. c. barroni from the 
    <a href="">Clarke Range</a> and the <a href="">Atherton Tableland</a> 
    in <a href="">Queensland</a>. The latter race is described as "poorly differentiated" and "possibly not worthy of recognition" by the 
    <a href=""></i>Handbook of the Birds of the World</em></a>.[12]

    The Surgeon-General of New South Wales <a href="">John White</a> caught a specimen in May 1788 calling it a yellow-faced flycatcher in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, 
    which was published in 1790.[13] Latham called it the black-cheeked warbler.[2] <a href="">John Gould</a> called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848,[14] which has become 
    its official name. It is also known as the yellow-gaped honeyeater, or the quitchup, in reference to its call.[15]</p>
